"Theorem 2.1: For non-negative additive valuations, $2n/(3n-1)$-MMS allocations can be found in polynomial time. The algorithm for this first reduces the problem to an ordered instance, and then applies a version of the Envy Cycle Elimination (ECE) algorithm.",
"Corollary 2.3: For non-negative additive valuations, we can reduce the problem of finding an α-MMS allocation to the special case of an ordered instance using Bouveret and Lemaître's reduction.",
"Lemma 2.5: For additive and ordered instances of goods, a version of the ECE algorithm outputs an EFX allocation.",
"Theorem 3.1: For non-negative submodular valuations, we can compute a 1/10-MMS allocation in polynomial time using a simple round-robin algorithm."
