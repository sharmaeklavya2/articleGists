    "Propositions 2, 4, 6, 7: MMS ⟹ PROP ⟹ MinMaxShare ⟹ EnvyFree ⟹ CEEI",
    "Proposition 1, 3: The following problems are NP-hard: 1. computing an agent's MMS share. 2. finding an MMS allocation. 3. checking if a PROP allocation exists.",
    "Proposition 10: For sum-normalized valuations, PROP ⟹ Egalitarian.",
    "Proposition 11: For binary valuations, the round-robin algorithm gives an MMS allocation in $O(m^2)$ time.",
    "Proposition 12: For identical valuations, MMS, PROP, envy-freeness, CEEI, and equitability are the same.",
    "Proposition 13: If $n-1$ agents have identical valuations, an MMS allocation exists.",

    "Experiments: Thousands of ordered fair division instances were randomly generated using IID (uniform and gaussion) valuations. MMS allocations were found to always exist."
