"Definition 2: A new class of valuations, called MMS-feasible valuations, that generalize additive and nice-cancelable valuations.",
"Theorem 2: EFX allocations exist when $n=3$ and at least one agent has an MMS-feasible valuation function.",
"Theorem 4: A polytime algorithm to find a partial $(1-ε)$-EFX allocation $X$ where no agent envies the charity bundle and the number of unallocated goods is $\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{n/ε})$. Furthermore, $X$ is $1/2$-MNW."
