"description": "For fair division of $m$ indivisible goods among $n$ agents with possibly unequal entitlements and additive valuations, this paper proposes a new notion of fairness called AnyPrice Share (APS), and shows how to compute an approximate APS allocation. Agent $i$ has entitlement $b_i$, where $\\sum_{i=1}^n b_i = 1$.",
