    "Theorem 2.1: For each $n ≥ 3$, there is an instance where an MMS allocation doesn't exist. $m$ may be exponential in $n$ in this instance.",
    "Introduced approximate MMS.",
    "Section 3: Algorithm for $ρ(1-ε)$-MMS, where $ε ≥ 0$ is a parameter to the algorithm, $ρ = 2n'/(3n'-1)$ $= (2/3)(1 + 1/(3n'-1))$, and $n'$ is the largest odd number such that $n' ≤ n$. The algorithm runs in polynomial time when $n$ and $ε$ are constants and $ε > 0$.",
    "Corollary of Section 3: When $n$ is constant, we can pick $ε = 1/(3n')$ to get $2/3$-MMS in polytime. When $n ∈ \\{3, 4\\}$, $3/4$-MMS exists."
