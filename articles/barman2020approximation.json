"Theorem 3.1: For non-negative additive valuations, $2n/(3n-1)$-MMS allocations can be found in polynomial time. The algorithm for this first reduces the problem to an ordered instance, and then applies a version of the Envy Cycle Elimination (ECE) algorithm.",
"Corollary 3.3: For additive valuations (for either goods or chores), we can reduce the problem of finding an α-MMS allocation to the special case of an ordered instance using Bouveret and Lemaître's reduction.",
"Lemma 3.5: For additive and ordered instances of goods, a version of the ECE algorithm outputs an EFX allocation.",
"Theorem 4.1: For non-negative submodular valuations, we can compute a $\\frac{1}{3}(1-\\frac{1}{e})$-MMS allocation (≈ 0.2107-MMS) in polynomial time using a simple round-robin algorithm.",
"Theorem A.2: For non-positive additive valuations, $(4n-1)/3n$-MMS allocations can be found in polynomial time. The algorithm for this first reduces the problem to an ordered instance, and then applies a version of the Envy Cycle Elimination (ECE) algorithm.",
"Section B.1: Consider a fair division instance with $n$ agents, $2n-1$ goods, and additive identical valuations, where $n-1$ goods have value $n$ and $n$ goods have value 1. Then there is an EF1 allocation that is not better than $1/n$-MMS.",
"Section B.2: There is a fair division instance with 2 agents, 4 goods, and submodular valuations, for which no allocation is better than $3/4$-MMS."
