    "Theorem 3.1: Let $c > 0$ be a constant. For each agent $i$, let $D_i$ be a probability distribution supported over $[0, 1]$ such that $\\Var(D_i) ≥ c$. Suppose $v_i(g)$ is independently randomly sampled from $D_i$ for each agent $i$ and good $g$. Then $∀ ε>0$, $∃ K$, such that if $\\max(n, m) ≥ K$, then an MMS allocation exists with probability $1-ε$ ($K$ depends on $ε$ and $c$)."
